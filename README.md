[00:00.38] Something's in the-
[00:09.88] 
[00:13.32] Something's in the air right now
[00:16.15] Like I'm losing track of time
[00:19.66] Like I don't really care right now, but maybe that's fine
[00:26.01] You weren't even there that day
[00:28.95] I was waitin' on you
[00:32.25] I wondered if you aware that day was the last straw for me and I know
[01:06.75] 
[00:41.83] I sent you flowers
[00:44.58] Did you even care?
[00:48.24] You ran the shower and left them by the stairs
[00:55.09] Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
[00:58.22] Ay-ay-ay-ay, ay, ay
[01:07.72] 
[01:01.54] Thought you had your shit together, but damn, I was wrong
[01:06.48] You ain't nothin' but a lost cause
[01:09.75] And this ain't nothin' like it once was
[01:12.74] I know you think you're such an outlaw
[01:16.73] But you got no job
[01:19.28] You ain't nothin' but a lost cause
[01:22.45] And this ain't nothin' like it oncе was
[01:25.55] I know you think you're such an outlaw
[01:29.57] But you got no job
[01:38.57] 
[01:30.82] I used to think you were shy
[01:33.81] But maybe you just had nothing on your mind
[01:37.31] Maybe you were thinkin' 'bout yourself all the time
[01:43.74] I used to wish you were mine
[01:47.06] But that was way before I realized
[01:50.12] Someone like you would always be so easy to find
[01:58.32] So easy (so easy)
[02:02.14] He-hee, mm-mm-mm, mm
[02:12.14] 
[02:11.31] Gave me no flowers
[02:14.27] Wish I didn't care
[02:17.32] You'd been gone for hours
[02:20.33] Could be anywhere
[02:24.53] Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
[02:28.79] Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
[02:35.79] 
[02:31.25] Thought you would've grown eventually, but you proved me wrong
[02:36.19] You ain't nothing but a lost cause
[02:39.24] And this ain't nothing like it once was
[02:42.40] I know you think you're such an outlaw (yeah)
[02:46.27] But you got no job
[02:49.08] You ain't nothing but a lost cause
[02:51.98] And this ain't nothing like it once was
[02:55.10] I know you think you're such an outlaw (think you're such an outlaw)
[02:59.33] But you got no job
[03:08.33] 
[03:01.77] What did I tell you?
[03:05.06] Don't get complacent
[03:08.06] It's time to face it now, na-na, na-na, na-na
[03:14.71] What did I tell you?
[03:17.84] Don't get complacent
[03:21.02] It's time to face it now, na-na-na
