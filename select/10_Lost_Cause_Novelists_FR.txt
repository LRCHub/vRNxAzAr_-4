Was it all just a dream or
Was it just the price to pay?
Now I'm left here to pray in silence
And you got what you wanted

I search for meaning
When all I used to do was dreaming
Disconsolate, mourning a loss, lonesome at best
Run away, but I can never escape from the pain in my brain
This fucking misery

I need a reason for who we are
I need to breathe throughout the war
I lost faith in myself again
I lost faith in myself again

Just breathe in (just breathe in)
Just breathe in (just breathe in)
And bury me, bury me
Just pretend (just pretend)
Just pretend (just pretend)
And run away, run away

(I'm slowly shutting down and)
I can't deny that all I do is losing control
You know I can't keep going on, this shit is taking its toll
But I can never escape, but I can never escape, fuck
But I can never escape
System failure

I need a reason for who we are
I need to breathe throughout the war
I lost faith in myself again
I lost faith in myself again
