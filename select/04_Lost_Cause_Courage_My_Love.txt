(Maybe I'm a lost cause)
(But I can tell you're the safe bet that I'm counting on)

If there's one thing you can count on
It's for me to let you down
Since the moment I could walk
I couldn't handle solid ground

If you want conversation
I'm too petrified to speak
But if you want hesitation
I'm the girl you need to meet

And if there's one thing that I could say
We're better off, so much better off this way
And I can't believe
No I can't believe that this came true
Waited my whole life to find you

Maybe I'm a lost cause
But I can tell you're the safe bet that I'm counting on
And it could be that it's all talk
But I'm holding my breath hoping that it's not
(Oh-wa-oh-wa-oh-wa-oh ooh)
I'm holding my breath, yeah I'm holding on, holding on
(Oh-wa-oh-wa-oh-wa-oh ooh)
Holding my breath, yeah I'm holding on, holding on

I leapt from a skyscraper when you crept into my head
And just when I'm about to fall you only pick me up instead
If words could ever tell you, oh I wish I could explain
How since the moment that I fell for you I've never been the same

And if there's one thing that I could say
We're better off, so much better off this way
And I can't believe
No I can't believe that this came true
I waited my whole life to find you

Maybe I'm a lost cause
But I can tell you're the safe bet that I'm counting on
And it could be that it's all talk
But I'm holding my breath hoping that it's not
(Oh-wa-oh-wa-oh-wa-oh ooh)
I'm holding my breath, yeah I'm holding on, holding on
(Oh-wa-oh-wa-oh-wa-oh ooh)
Holding my breath, yeah I'm holding on

And everything you said going through my head now
Now I can't forget, no I can't forget
Everything you said ringing in my head loud
No I can't forget you

(Maybe I'm a lost cause)
But I can tell you're the safe bet that I'm counting on
It could be that it's all talk
But I'm holding my breath hoping that it's not
(Oh-wa-oh-wa-oh-wa-oh ooh)
I'm holding my breath, yeah I'm holding on, holding on
(Oh-wa-oh-wa-oh-wa-oh ooh)
Holding my breath, yeah I'm holding on, holding on
